# JADynamics — A New Paradigm in Building Security
## No More Keys: Unlock with a Smile!

JADynamics aims to be a household name in building access control by producing biometric authenticated locks. More than just a lock company, we want to provide secure, convenient, and reliable access to homes and businesses — completely hands free. Utilizing recent developments in facial recognition technology, our devices will make it possible to identify authorized users in a fraction of a second with more accuracy than even traditional fingerprint-based biometric systems. 

## Security-Focused, Privacy Conscious

Frequently, new technological conveniences come with the added downsides of a loss of privacy as well as the risks associated with data insecurity. It is our mission to ensure that clients can trust our devices both in their homes and places of work. The systems we are developing are fully self contained, your data never leaves the premises unless remote access is desired. With JADynamics, you can be confident that your data remains your data.

## Technology that Recognizes the Real You

Traditional locks and access control systems rely on thier users keeping track keys, access cards, or PINs alone to identify people. These systems are not only inconvenient and prone to loss, but often enable bad actors access to homes and businesses through theft. Our systems recognize you for the real you — not just the keys in your pocket.
