# JADynamics Business Plan

## Long-Term Vision

The goal of JADynamics is to produce biometric authenticated locks that automatically unlock when approached by authorized users. The company will provide a convenient and secure solution to building access by utilizing recent developments in biometrics, including low-cost computer vision and range imaging technologies. JADynamics will integrate these technologies into products marketed toward residential and enterprise applications. 

Our team was inspired by the exciting developments in infrared-based biometrics, such as Apple’s faceID and Microsoft’s Kinect. 

The core values of JADynamics are security and data privacy. Frequently, new technological conveniences come with the added downsides of a loss of privacy as well as the risks associated with data insecurity. It is our mission to ensure that clients can trust our devices both in their homes and places of work. We will achieve this by creating systems that are fully self-contained and do not require exporting user data outside of the home or enterprise network as well as providing transparency and flexibility to the data that is stored locally.

## Who We Are

We are a team of four Computer Science undergraduate students from California State University East Bay. We each bring unique skills and experience to the team which will enable us to take JADynamics from concept to reality.

## Timeline

### 0–18 months: Research & Design

During this period, our team of experts will be hard at work designing & prototyping our initial product. We'll also be working with manufacturing partners abroad at this stage to ensure that our products can be made economically and en masse. 

### 18–24 months: Enter Production

After we've locked in a design that meets our standards we'll work with our manufacturing partner on creating the necessary tooling for an initial production run. During this period we'll be doing regular quality checks and field testing our devices in real world environments.

### 24–36 months: Sales growth in the consumer market

Once our products are in production we will strategically market them to target consumers. We believe that homeowners will provide the highest potential for growth. Platforms such as NextDoor as well as advertisements location-targeted to suburban neighborhoods on other platforms offer great opportunities to push into this market. In addition, we believe our stance on data privacy will resonate with technology enthusiasts. To enter this market, we work with technology influencers to create sponsored reviews and advertisements on social media platforms. 

### 36 months and beyond:

As we grow and become a recognized name in building access control we will begin our entrance into markets beyond residential. New products will be developed catering to security focused organizations, such as industrial enterprises and governmental organizations. We believe our closed system approach to security will appeal to these customers. Trade shows for high technology industries, such as the A&D Aerospace Manufacturing Conference and the Money 20/20 Banking Conference will provide opportunities to showcase our technology and build relationships with potential organizational customers. In addition, we will be engaging in aggressive direct marketing to high value targets.


## External Opportunities

JADynamics is in a unique position to capitalize on a number of external opportunities. 

### Co-marketing: 
We can partner with other companies in the security and biometric space to expand our market presence. For example, we can partner with a lock manufacturer to create a co-branded product that utilizes our software to provide a secure and convenient solution to home access. 

### Venture Capital Funding: 
We can look to venture capital firms that have helped grow security technologies in the past to support our growth, such as Accel and Softbank. This will enable us to expand our customer base, increase our marketing reach, and develop new products. 

### Conferences: 
We can attend conferences such as the International Biometric Industry Association (IBIA) to stay up to date on the latest developments in the industry and establish relationships with potential partners.
