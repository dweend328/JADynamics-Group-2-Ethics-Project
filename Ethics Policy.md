Welcome to JADynamics, the very first facial recognition doorbell! Everyone here wants you to be a part of the JADynamics family.

At JADynamics, we strongly believe in our founding principle “convenient safety”. 

Here below are the objectives for our app-controlled doorbell and added security:

We aspire to create a secure, state of the art doorbell that recognizes faces, to the discretion of the homeowner. This will give the homeowner full-control of who’s allowed in the home. In our app, we have categorized four columns which give the following access and certain privileges:

Residents: This is reserved for all the residents of a house. Anyone in that category who walks in is automatically granted access.

Family: This is reserved for close family members, and those guests will always be welcome.

Guests: This is reserved for friends and guests at the homeowner’s discretion.

Banned: Needless to say, this is reserved for guests who are banned from the premises. Anyone who enters

2. We aspire to add security to your place of residence to ensure that extra layer of comfort and safety. This is exactly what the product aims to provide.

3. JADynamics aims to lower the crime rate in neighborhoods of lower class by using the camera feature, and the app that comes along with it.



While JADynamics adheres to the principles highlighted above, the following are principles that JADynamics does not support:

The use of tampering the internal face camera to break into homes. With the all-new technology designed with these cameras, we are able to tell the difference between a photograph, and a real human.

Hacking the user interface of any kind. This is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated. Our doorbell is designed to ensure an extra layer of safety, and modifying it will affect the product.

The collection of individual data. Most companies are known to do this, but we ethically cannot afford to do this, as this can hurt users.



With JADynamics as just a startup, we are seeking talented individuals to build this company from the ground up. 

Satya Nadella, (M.S., M.B.A.)


Satya Nadella is an Indian-American businessman, who is currently the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Microsoft, one of the biggest technology companies in the world. He started off as the senior vice-president of research and development (R&D) for the Online Services Division and vice-president of the Microsoft Business Division. He did this for 22 years before getting promoted to CEO. After becoming CEO, the stock for Microsoft nearly tripled (citation).

Microsoft is a top 5 technology company. Given the guidance of a long-term employee of Microsoft, and the CEO, we need someone to oversee all the operations. As someone who helped the company grow annually, we feel that Nadella would be the best option to help make JADynamics grow.

2. Jack Black, American Actor

Jack Black is an American actor from Santa Monica, California. He went to UCLA but dropped to pursue a career in entertainment. He now plays in movies such as Kung Fu Panda, the newest Juamnji movies, and the most recent Super Mario Bros Movie.

Jack Black would be a great candidate for marketing, as we need to appeal to a large age group who knows about him. We chose to sponsor Jack Black for advertisements and marketing so the general public knows about this startup.

3. Bill Gates, cofounder of Microsoft


William “Bill” Gates, is a philanthropist, entrepreneur and investor. He is widely regarded as one of the most successful businessmen of all time. He co-founded Microsoft along with his childhood best friend in 1975. He was CEO for 25 years until stepping down in January of 2000. Although he is no longer affiliated with Microsoft, he has pursued many philanthropic endeavors.

We could hire an abundance of workers who have experience with software development, but we can only hire so many of those. In order to run a successful start-up, we need someone to help with our finances and accounting. As the cofounder of Microsoft, Bill Gates has enough experience to give us the proper guidance to become the company we strive to become.
